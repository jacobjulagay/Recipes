    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> Making lasagna can be time-consuming, but the results are well worth the wait. 
        You'll find a detailed ingredient list and step-by-step instructions in the recipe below, but let's go over the basics.
    </p>
    <h2>Hamburger Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Hamburger</li>
        <li>Buns</li>
        <li>Cheese</li>
        <li>Lettuce</li>
        <li>Pickles</li>
        <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
        <li>Tomato</li>
        <li>Onions</li>
        <li>Yellow Mustard</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Special Sauce Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Mayonnaise</li>
        <li>Ketchup</li>
        <li>Sweet Pickle Relish</li>
        <li>White vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How to Carmelize Onions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely chop your onion and add into a frying pan with oil. Stir and saute for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Cover them and allow them to cook slow for about 30 minutes until they are golden and soft.  Watch your heat and donâ€™t let them burn.  </li>
        <li>Uncover them once they have started to brown and caramelize and cook for about 5 more minutes uncovered. </li>
        <li>Add in 1/2 C water and simmer until the water evaporates.  </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Making the burger</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Toast the Buns.  This is one of the things I love about an In-N- Out Burger!  Heat up your electric griddle and brush it lightly with some vegetable oil.  Place your buns split side down on the griddle and toast until golden brown.</li>

        <li>Form your hamburger patties.  I made my patties thicker than In-N-Out, but you can make them thinner for a more authentic experience.  Add a sprinkle of salt and pepper to both sides.</li>
        <li>Place your patties on your hot griddle (these hamburgers are not put on a BBQ grill) </li>
        <li>Cook for 3-5 minutes, depending on the thickness of your patty and your desired doneness. </li>
        <li>Spread the patty with 1 1/2 tsp of mustard on the uncooked side and then flip</li>
        <li>Top the cooked side with a slice of cheese. In-N-Out uses American cheese but I used a nice slice of cheddar.  Again, make it with the cheese you love, or use American for an authentic In-N-Out burger!</li>

        <li>After cooking to your desired doneness you are ready to assemble your burger</li>
        <li>Spread some of the burger sauce on your bun.</li>
        <li>Add lettuce, tomato, hamburger patty and caramelized onions.</li>
    </ol>
